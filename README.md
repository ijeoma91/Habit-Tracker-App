Python 3.8

### Project Description (Introduction)

The main objective of this app development is to build a running habit tracker that eventually helps the user to 
stay mindful and accountable for their goal or bad habit they want to control.  To help the user to actualize those goals, 
this app was created and the following enlisted activities can be performed using the app 

1	Create a habit

2	Show daily habits

3	Show weekly habits

4	Remove daily habits

5	Remove weekly habits

6	A user can save and track daily habits

7	He/she can see/show currently tracked daily habits

8	The user can save and track his weekly habits

9	He/she can show currently tracked weekly habits

10	He/she can now perform the daily habits which he created

11	Finally, perform the weekly habits which he/she created

With the listed activities mentioned above, the user can checked-off whenever a habit is completed. 
HabitTrackingAppToday is the name of the App and its performers will measure, quantify and track their progress in various ways.



## INSTALLATION PROCEDURES

Software development is one of the major tasks which requires the most resourceful environments that not just help the developers/programmers 
write code but also allow software production. This is the sole purpose of an IDE, Atom. It is free and open source software.
It is a desktop application that is designed to serve Python programmers in their endeavours. We can run the program in Atom Text Editor and command prompt. 
Python is a free open source software available on different platforms such as Windows, Linux or macOS. Check if your PC is 64 or 32 bits.
Then select either windows x86-64 executable installer or Windows x86 executable installer for 64-bit or 32 bit.

##### Step 1	 Python Installation

Go to google and type *python.org/downloads/*. After typing it, it will take you to the python official website where you can download the python. 
It will look like the picture below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92203208/152688838-2d569e10-9b9b-4658-b412-6a61580bff15.png)
Now python 3.8 is set to run.

### Second Installation is Atom

Now that python 3.8 is set on your PC, the next step is to install the Atom Text Editor. But before we proceed with the installation procedures, 
firstly, I will elaborate on what the Atom text editor means and the main reason why Atom was the best choice for this application.
Normally, the basic way to create and run a python program is to create an empty file with a .py extension and then point to that file from the command line
with python filename.py or the programmer can use IDLE which comes as a default application along with python to execute your code.
However, for effective, efficient and productive work, the two options will not be the best options rather the programmer needs something more 
reliable and productive. That is where the Atom comes in.
Generally, Atom does not have features in the traditional sense, rather packages are created to add to its hackable core.
These installed packages provide all the features necessary like auto-complete, code-line and code highlighters.
######What is Atom text editor? Atom is an open-source text editor for multiple platforms, which supports packages developed in Node.js and
has support for Git version control. Most of the packages are freely available and built by open-source communities. 
It is developed and maintained by GitHub, built using web technologies as a desktop application.

Step 1 Atom Installation
To download Atom python text editor, click on the link https://atom.io/. The link will automatically detect your current operating system and show you the corresponding setup file to download.
When the link is open, the interface looks like this image below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92203208/152688852-862ffe26-2251-4267-be17-a4db1c4eb06a.png)

##### Step 2
Click on the download button. Once the download and the installation are completed, Atom will automatically open in the default directory and it like look like this below image:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92203208/152688865-f9577d75-cd7a-4674-91aa-7d16702ad539.png)

For our code to run on the Atom Text Editor, we only need two packages to be installed. They are:
1. Script (Run code in Atom)
2. Atom-python-run (Run a python source file)
Let look at how to install some packages in our python Atom Text Editor so we can run our app.

###### Step 1
Click on the file on the top of the menu bar

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92203208/152688882-42494424-2b79-4b6a-9d1d-00ec7489bd1e.png)

##### Step 2
When clicked, then click on the setting and this image below will pop-up

##### Step 3
Next click on the install below the menu where the arrow is pointing. Another image will appear.
On the search engine, search for the two packages that I mentioned previously (Script and Atom-python-run) and install them.
After the installation of those two packages, then click on the package on the setting menu and check the packages that you installed.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92203208/152688908-f4cdc94f-2026-45d5-8c54-518c9d2759a1.png)

##### Step 4
When the installation is complete and ready, your package pop-up menu will look like the picture below.

It is optional to click on the setting to see what each package does and its contents. Now your Atom Text Editor is ready to run your code

#### Next phase
##### Step 1

Program (Code) Running Phase
This is the main phase of the project (Portfolio). Now that all the installation is ready, it is time to export the code from your PC. 
The codes will be in a zip file. Just open and store it on your PC. The location is your choice.

To open your code, click where the arrow is pointing at and then find the location where your code folder is stored.

Important Note: Reference to the picture above, below are the explanations.

###### Descriptions of the above screenshoot: 
The name of the App: HabitTrackingAppToday.
DailyHabits.Json: This is where the daily habits are stored 
Habit.py: This contained all habits classes created
HabitTraker.py: This is the User menu ( The main Menu for user interaction)
Task.py: This is user tasks classes
Test_user.py: This is code/program tester
User.py: This is a user class
WeeklyHabits.Json: This is where the weekly habits are stored and tracked

##### Step 3
To interact with the program to create, view etc. your habits, use the HabitTraker.py.
Carefully look at the picture below because it contains all the activities, tasks and performances of the app. When clicked, the view will look like this image below:

### 4 weeks of Daily and Weekly Habits Documentation

This Habit Tracker app was used, tested and implemented during and after its creation. To store our data (habits) both daily and weekly habits, 
a JSON file was implemented and used. After making sure that all functionality is working and stable, the app was used for 4 weeks so it can be tested before 
launching the app to the client (Users). With the JSON file, below are the documented habits that were implemented and performed.

#### Documented Daily Habits File (DailyHabits.json)
 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92203208/152689063-edcfb7bd-6276-415a-aa0c-dcc1bc5db8e1.png)

#### Documented Weekly Habits File (WeeklyHabits.json)

##### Step 2
To save your daily habits in the DailyHabits.json file, simply press the 6 buttons for daily while 8 for weekly. 
For example, since I have created a daily habit named *children vitamins intakes* above. Now let's save it, view it and perform the task.

First to save press the 6 button

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92203208/152689115-8b03990c-0052-49e3-91fa-9d0e4950928a.png)

##### Step 3

To show your saved daily created habit, press 7

Here we have the habits that we recently created with additional pre-defined habits (Hardcoded habits) stored together. 

##### Step 4
Now it is time to perform a habit from the created daily habit

To do so, press 10 (Note you must spell your habit name correctly)
Firstly, this image will appear then choose and type  the habit you want to perform under and then start.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92203208/152689135-f789a8e8-7d2e-4a9f-b18e-38ea8d06c954.png)

Press 1 when you completed each task or 0 if you are not able to fine.

##### Final result

##### Step 5
To view your completed task
You can view the DailyHabits.json file or press the 7 buttons to show currently tracked daily habits.

If you check the last habit, you can see that it is completed while the other ones are not because we only performed one habit.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92203208/152689185-384c16a3-04e7-4031-a07a-7a428819d4b5.png)

To view your habits in Json file

You can see that the last habit we created is already saved in the JSON file permanently. Just the way daily habit was created, weekly habit habits can be created as well.

### Weekly habit Creation
With our Command Prompt still active, we can create our weekly habit by following these steps


##### Step 1

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92203208/152689196-05975441-7817-4c81-8bda-0fc4d8b16407.png)

Reference to the command prompt on step 1, we can see that to create a weekly habit we press 3 buttons after we must have pressed 1 to create a habit.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92203208/152689205-42db7ca4-e5b2-4480-9dbe-57d1da6230fd.png)

After you must have listed everything, Press Enter key and that is done.

##### Step 2 
The next step is to save a habit so we can be able to track it when needed. To save weekly habits we have to press the 8 buttons and an interface will pop-up 
showing that our habit was successfully saved.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92203208/152689214-464ed013-fc57-4241-9893-c086b0f57185.png)

##### Step 3
To view our weekly habits, we will press the 9 buttons and the output is below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92203208/152689225-7581a599-9652-4129-bb7a-2c094bc8c728.png)

##### Step 4

To perform weekly habits that we have created. For example, let’s perform second to the last have listed above-called *Take out the trash*. 
To perform this weekly habit we press the 11 buttons and the app will enlist all the weekly habits, there you can choose and type the habit you want to perform. 
Note that you must type correctly.

###### Habit: Take out the trash: In this habit, we have two tasks to perform here
  o	The first task is to take the full trash bag out
  o	The second task is to put a new trash bag

Below is the output of the weekly performed habit.
